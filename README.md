🚗 Anti-Sleep Driver Alert System

👀 What is this project about?

Have you ever felt drowsy while driving late at night or on a long trip? Fatigue is one of the leading causes of road accidents. Our project, 
the Anti-Sleep Driver Alert System,is designed to tackle this problem by detecting early signs of drowsiness and giving the driver a timely wake-up alert.
We built a pair of smart goggles with a blink sensor that continuously tracks eye movements. If the driver’s eyes remain closed for too long, the system triggers 
an alert using a buzzer, LED, or vibration motor—helping the driver stay awake and safe.

🎯 Why we built this

To reduce accidents caused by drowsy driving.
To provide a low-cost, portable, and user-friendly solution.
To support long-distance and commercial drivers who often struggle with fatigue.
To create a system that can be scaled and adopted by vehicle manufacturers in the future.

⚙️ How it works

Blink Sensor (mounted on goggles) keeps track of blinking patterns.
Arduino Uno processes the sensor data in real-time.
If unusual blinking or prolonged eye closure is detected → Alert is triggered.
The driver gets notified instantly via buzzer, LED flash, or vibration.
⏱ Alert response time: Less than 1 second.
🔋 Battery life: Runs 6–8 hours on a single charge.

🛠 Tech Stack

Hardware → Arduino Uno, IR sensor/photodiode, buzzer, vibration motor, LED, rechargeable battery.
Software → Arduino IDE for programming and testing.
Prototype → Lightweight goggles with integrated blink detection.

📊 What we tested

Sensor accuracy → 99% detection rate for drowsy blinks.
Alert mechanism → Instant and effective without distracting the driver.
Battery performance → Stable operation for long drives.
User feedback → Comfortable to wear and easy to use.

🌍 Why this matters

This project isn’t just about building a gadget—it’s about saving lives.
🚦 Safer roads → Fewer fatigue-related accidents.
👨‍✈️ Helps truck/bus drivers → Long-haul drivers can stay alert longer.
🏥 Public health → Raises awareness about sleep and driving safety.
💰 Cost savings → Reduced accident-related healthcare and repair costs.
